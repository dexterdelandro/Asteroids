# Asteroids
 A 2D remake of the classic Asteroids game made for a class project.
 
 This was an academic project, where we had to recreate the classic Asteroids game in Unity. I implemented a vector-based physics system using acceleration and direction vectors to move the ship, asteroids, and bullets. To go beyond what the project entailed, I created two different game modes, an endless mode and a mode with a target score. I also developed a menu system to make the project feel like a complete game.
 
 To run the game, download the "Delandro_Asteroids_Build" folder, and then run "Delandro_Asteroids.exe"
